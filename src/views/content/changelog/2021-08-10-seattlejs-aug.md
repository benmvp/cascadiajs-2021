## Balancing Flexibility and Productivity in Content Modeling

Speaker: [Sean C. Davis](https://www.seancdavis.com)

Topics: cms, content modeling, jamstack, decoupled, front end

Speaker: [James Hush](http://www.jameshush.com)

Topics: devops, testing, automation

Overworked software engineers have to deal with broken products and unmet expectations on a daily basis. Lead Engineer James Hush shows that we already have the time to do proactive, long-term work as engineers—no matter the size of the company.
