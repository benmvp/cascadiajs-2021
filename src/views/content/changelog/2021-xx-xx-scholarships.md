Over the last few years, we have worked with local tech companies and our community to fund *hundreds* of scholarships to CascadiaJS.

If you are a member of a under-represented group in tech or have a financial need, please apply!

If you work for a tech company that cares about a more diverse and inclusive tech community, please consider sponsoring a scholarship!
